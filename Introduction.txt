A Bianry search tree is a special form of a binary tree. 

1. The value in each node must be greater than (or equal to) any values
stored in its left subtree
2. The value in each node must be less than (or equal to) any values
stored in its right subtree

Like a normal binary tree, we can traverse a BST in prorder, inorder, postorder
or level-order. However, it is noteworth that inorder traversal in BST
will be in ascending order. Therefore, the inorder traversal is the most
frequent used traversal method of a BST
